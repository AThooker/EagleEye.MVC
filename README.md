# Eagle Eye (MVC design pattern)
## Austin Hooker
#### *Software Development Bootcamp @ Eleven Fifty Academy*

The final requirement to earn the Red Badge for this program was to create an ASP.Net web application using the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. My .Net Framework MVC Web Application provides users the ability to report any curious situations in which someone may be or has been a victim of human trafficking. This application allows users to input what they saw, who was involved(if they saw someone), the times at which it took place, and any of their own past reports. They can also go back into their account and update anything else they think of at a later date. This app allows for an administrator of the app to go in and see the entire database, whether it be all victims, all perps, or all incidents. The admin also has the authority to delete objects while the lay user does not.

#### How to install the project locally:
<br />
<i>(This application was built and tested in Visual Studio)</i>
<br />
<br />
1.	Go to https://github.com/AThooker/EagleEye.MVC/tree/master 
<br />
2.	On this page, make sure you are on the master branch (located directly above the blue box containing the name of the last committed changes)
<br />
3.	Once you know you are on the master branch, click the green box containing “Code” and copy the URL given in the dropdown menu, either by copying the link manually or clicking the clipboard icon.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4.	Now you can navigate to where you’d like the project to be stored, and open your command prompt. 
<br />
5.	In your command prompt, type “git clone”, put a space after “clone”, then paste the URL you copied from Github. Press enter and the project should clone to your local computer.
<br />
6.	After the project is cloned, if there are build errors then you may have to restore NuGet packages that come along with the project. Another solution may be restarting Visual Studio.
